.Sh DESCRIPTION
The isspam utility provides a command-line interface to the IsSpam Ruby class, which performs Bayesian filtering on potential spam, in a manner very similar to the approach described in Paul Graham's essay "A Plan for Spam" <http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html>.
This utility can take incoming messages either on stdin or as file arguments.  The input may contain multiple messages, which will be distinguished by a Unix "from" header (/^From /).  Thus, you can use an entire mail folder (in mbox format) as input, or individual messages.
The
.Op Fl ynpd
options are mutually exclusive.  Incoming messages may be treated as spam, not spam, or be tested for spam.
.Sh OPTIONS

.It Fl p, probability

.It Fl d, dump

.It Fl f, file Ar database
Specify the database to use (default is ~/.isspam.db).  The database will be created if it does not exist.
